Modern talking

You're My Heart, You're My Soul

Deep in my heart, there's a fire, a burnin' heart
Deep in my heart, there's desire for a start
I'm dying in emotion
It's my world in fantasy…

I'm livin' in my, livin' in my dreams
You're my heart, you're my soul
I keep it shining everywhere I go
You're my heart, you're my soul
I'll be holding you forever
Stay with you together
